== Motivation

There are two situations in which we need to launch fully-fledged Stackable clusters:

* in our CI/CD pipelines' integration *tests*
* when we want to help customers with issues by reproducing their environments (*troubleshooting*)

== High Level Architecture
The following diagram shows at a very high level how T2 is integrated into the workflow of setting up a Stackable environment on a cloud provider.

1. The user sends a cluster definition to T2, this can optionally already include a definition of services that should be set up on the platform (see link:docs/using-t2.adoc#yaml[The Stackable cluster definition YAML]).
2. T2 generates Terraform and Ansible code from this cluster definition and executes this against a cloud provider to instantiate VMs (4 in this example) and provision them with the base Stackable components.
3. After the base platform has been provisioned T2 acts as a Stackable client and posts the initial product config - if one was specified in the call to T2. +
From a technical point of view this means creating custom resources in the Kubernetes that backs the Stackable platform.
4. At this point the user can interact with the cluster via the kube-apiserver to add / remove / manage the needed tools.

== The two ways to create clusters with T2

A running T2 instance provides a restful API which provides you with two ways to create a cluster:

* The cluster can be launched by T2 inside a cloud infrastructure.
* You can download a package with all the required Terraform and Ansible files to launch the cluster using your own tools and cloud provider account.

While the former method is not publicly available to everyone and requires authentication, we are happy to provide the latter method free of charge and publicly accessible. Please understand that the scripts we provide come without any warranty.

== Using T2

See link:docs/using-t2.adoc[this document] to learn how you can use T2 to create Stackable clusters.

== Running T2

See link:docs/running-t2.adoc[this document] to learn how you can run T2 on premise.
